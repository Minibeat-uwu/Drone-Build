# Drone-Build
I had to start somewhere and build something during the summer, so I decided to build a drone. 

## Getting started:

I got most of the parts during the last summer, but due to the awful soldering iron I had, I need to get a replacement during this summer, which I finally got.
This is gonna be my first ever build on any actual stuff, so the progress is going to be extremely slow.

##Progress:

Finally got started on the build. I had some experience with the solder, but it was kinda difficult to get the wire into place when I got nothing to hold it together.
Other than that, I got all 4 ESCs connected to the PDB, but still haven't fully connected the motors to the ESC. OOF!

Finished soldering all the ESC and motors together and connected all the pins to the control panel. However, I made a huge mistake of not properly checking what to do (lack of research), I'm missing couple parts again, and also messed up couple area that I need to fix immidiately. 
List of Fixes that is needed:
1) I need to desolder the power plug on the control panel so I can connect a wire to extend that plug. 
2) Rewire some of the locations to make it look a bit nicer
3) Buy more parts, because I was an idiot last year and didn't properly researched.
4) Need to get a decent helping hand, cause it's kinda hard to solder some of the pins & wires
