# Drone-Build
I had to start somewhere and build something during the summer, so I decided to build a drone. 

## Getting started:

I got most of the parts during the last summer, but due to the awful soldering iron I had, I need to get a replacement during this summer, which I finally got.
This is gonna be my first ever build on any actual stuff, so the progress is going to be extremely slow.

##Progress:

Finally got started on the build. I had some experience with the solder, but it was kinda difficult to get the wire into place when I got nothing to hold it together.
Other than that, I got all 4 ESCs connected to the PDB, but still haven't fully connected the motors to the ESC. OOF!
