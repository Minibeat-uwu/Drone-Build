2019-05-03:

Finally got started on the build. I had some experience with the solder, but it was kinda difficult to get the wire into place when I got nothing to hold it together. Other than that, I got all 4 ESCs connected to the PDB, but still haven't fully connected the motors to the ESC. OOF!

Finished soldering all the ESC and motors together and connected all the pins to the control panel. However, I made a huge mistake of not properly checking what to do (lack of research), I'm missing couple parts again, and also messed up couple area that I need to fix immidiately. List of Fixes that is needed:

1) I need to desolder the power plug on the control panel so I can connect a wire to extend that plug.
2) Rewire some of the locations to make it look a bit nicer
3) Buy more parts, because I was an idiot last year and didn't properly researched.
4) Need to get a decent helping hand, cause it's kinda hard to solder some of the pins & wires

All the wires are connected, but somehow the flight controller is not getting any power. I tried to flash the controller to see if that was the issue, but doesn't look like it was.

Found the issue, the voltage regulator of the flight controller was fried. This may be due to the wrong voltage input from the pcb.

Decided to use arduino nano and MPU-6050(gyro) and create my own flight controller from there. I'm still going to use the same receiver from the package that I bought.
Now, I just need to wait for all the parts to arrive... hopefully get the pcb from amazon quick so I can progress from this proj... what am i doing...

Got the gyro and the pcbs to attach all the things together. I did finished the circuit drawing for it through this website, so lets see how it goes.

Planning out the connection and the wires

2019-06-04
Due to the lack of wires I have, I'm trying to improvise it by salvaging the previous dead flight controller plugs. At least, I got all the connection plans made.

2019-06-05
Started soldering the connection between the gyro and the arduino.
2hr later...
connections are made, but I need to stop. My stomach doesn't feel too gooddddd.....

2019-06-06
I finished all the soldering... arduino nano to gyro and bunch of wires so that I can use it for the connection between arduino to receiver.

2019-06-08
Just spent my whole time adding shrink tube to all the connection because I don't have any cover for the connection... It's time consuming and tedious, but this is what I get.

I just followed the instruction that was on youtube. I did finish downloading the multiwii and successfully uploaded,l but somehow it's not responding properly.
I checked if the connection was improper, but I don't see any issues.

The pins to arduino wasn't properly made, so the power wasn't really going into the arduino. Thus, I added some solder to reconnect the circuit.

2019-06-12
multiwii IS uploaded to the arduino nano, but somehow when everything is powered on, the transmitter is not being relaied to the receiver.
About an hour or so, due to ppm activation, it denied the information from the pwm connection. After a quick re-upload, it was able to read the input from the receiver.

2019-06-13
Further issues were found from the software side:
1) Arduino can't read the roll and AUX 2 input
2) GPS direction is constantly turning at CCW
3) It's able to read when it's connected to the usb, but when it's connected to the battery, it doesn't read anything. (Basically, multiwii becomes like a dead boi)
4) Out of all the activation: ARM, ANGLE, HORIZON, Angle is the only that doesn't want to activate
5) When the drone is powered by the battery, it doesn't want to be ARMed

I can definitely see some response when I connect it to the usb, because it's sending a signal to send power to the motor. But when I plug in the battery while I have the usb connected, the response just dies.
I still have to research more on the multiwii, but it's almost there boissssss!!! AHHHH I WANT TO JUST FINISH THIS BUGGER.

The receiver side does send out the roll output (Ch 1), but the arduino isn't receiving that info. Witch means, the D4 pin of the arduino nano isn't properly working.
Further more, it is still refusing to arm when I connect it directly to the battery. At first, I thought it was due to the lack of flashing to the ESC, but looks like it wasn't needed.
I still have to research why it's still not arming when it's dead right now. damb it.
